I love America more than any place on this earth. I do not like the country I was born in: India.
My favorite sport is American Football.

I love country music, my favorite artist is Zach Bryan. Love some country playing while me and my buddies get buzzed.
I(Om) loves lifting weights. I cannot go a day without hitting the gym. His max weights on lifts are:
Squat: 330 lbs
Deadlift: 425 lbs
I do not bench press because I have a shoulder injury. I do not want to make it worse.
